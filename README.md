**Website:** [pooshit.dev](https://pooshit.dev) · **Docs:** [pooshit.dev/docs](https://pooshit.dev/docs) · **npm:** [`pooshit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pooshit)

```bash
npx pooshit
```

![Deploy demo](demo/pooshit-demo.gif)

## Quick start

Deploy any project folder:

```bash
cd my-app
npx pooshit
```

You get a public URL on `*.pooshit.dev`. Free tier: 50 MB, live for 24 hours.

## What works

| You have | What to do |
|----------|------------|
| `index.html` in a folder | `cd` that folder → `npx pooshit` |
| Node app with `start` script | `cd` project → `npx pooshit` |
| Vite / React / SPA | `npm run build` → `cd dist` → `npx pooshit` |
| Dockerfile | `cd` project → `npx pooshit` |

Run from the folder you want live — not the monorepo root unless that *is* the app.

## Local development

```bash
git clone …/hostie && cd hostie
npm install

# Terminal 1 — API
npm run dev:api

# Terminal 2 — CLI against local API
cd /path/to/my-project
POOSHIT_API_URL=http://localhost:3099 npm run pooshit
```

## Monorepo
